# The Art of Game Design Notes

Notes for the textbook [Art of game design](./art-of-game-design.pdf) by Jesse Schell

` `  
` `  

I've realized I suck at making games, but I'd also rather choose a class on compiler design then game design. So I'm just going to read this for fun in my free time.

I'm also trying to justify why I'm making games on the gameboy, since I feel like computers now are just so fast where any tricks I learn with assembly will be marginal. Maybe it will fundamentally change how I code but I can't guarantee that. So the justification is that it is a challenge for me, where I'll try to make fun games with the limited resources of the gameboy.

# Prologue - 0

The goal is to teach how to be a better video game designer. Works for all kinds of games, more general universal things will be talked about. 

## What is Game Design?

***"Game design is the act of deciding what a game should be."***

Important to note that this is a ongoing project. I assume they mean that you have a basic game idea but throughout development and testing, you constantly make changes to ensure the quality of the game.

Games have been around for all of humanity. These concepts can be applied to video games. **Game like board games and card games share the concepts. The medium in which they're expressed is different.** A video game is just a concept expressed through code.

Some decisions you may need to consider are, story decisions, rules, looks and feels, timing, pacing, risk-taking, rewards and punishments.

Again it is a ongoing process, ideas may not execute like how they were originally planed to. This way of thinking should be used throughout the game development.

**I'm realizing that I don't do any of this. I'll have a idea that I think is good, work for a year with my head down and then see if its fun after I'm done making it.**

## Waiting for Mendeleev

I apparently did not pass chemistry, Mandelevv discovered the periodic table. The idea is that there is no universal formula. Maybe there will be eventually, but we need to rely on assumptions and patterns that may be wrong and incomplete. 

**Good game design happens when you view the game from as many perspectives as possible.** Each perspective or lense is a tool to examine the game. They are questions you can ask and think about. Like all of the different reactions that those OChem ppl have to remember. Use as many imperfect lenses as you can to emulate a single lense of truth.

## Focus on Fundamentals
**The rules that govern games stay the same.** New 100 gb games by AAA companies still have the same basic principles. You don't need to chase them. *Study simple games first.* **Hopefully thats what I can accomplish with this gameboy project.** These old classic games are good to study because they withstood the test of time.

***"This book will not strive to cover ground, but to teach you to dig in the most fertile places."***

## Talk to Strangers

More so refers to the strangers of techniques, practices and principles. Don't just bury your head in work, engage with the outside world and integrate them into the games.

**No Cookie-cutter games**, playing it safe is boring. ***This is honestly my biggest fear when it comes to making games, I feel like after I master making fun games, there is nothing stopping me. I would have full confidence I could succeed.*** Draw design inspiration from everywhere.

## The map

**This book presents you with a bunch of nodes. But you have to make you're own web of connections through trial and error.** Books are linear, so you need to construct the network of relationships in your own brain.

**Practice, make games, thats the only way to learn. You can't learn how to ride a bike from reading a book.**

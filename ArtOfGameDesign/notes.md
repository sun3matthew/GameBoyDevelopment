# The Art of Game Design Notes

Notes for the textbook [Art of game design](./art-of-game-design.pdf) by Jesse Schell

I've realized I suck at making games, but I'd also rather choose a class on compiler design then game design. So I'm just going to read this for fun in my free time.

I'm also trying to justify why I'm making games on the gameboy, since I feel like computers now are just so fast where any tricks I learn with assembly will be marginal. Maybe it will fundamentally change how I code but I can't guarantee that. So the justification is that it is a challenge for me, where I'll try to make fun games with the limited resources of the gameboy.

# Prologue - 0

The goal is to teach how to be a better video game designer. Works for all kinds of games, more general universal things will be talked about. 

## What is Game Design?

***"Game design is the act of deciding what a game should be."***

Important to note that this is a ongoing project. I assume they mean that you have a basic game idea but throughout development and testing, you constantly make changes to ensure the quality of the game.

Games have been around for all of humanity. These concepts can be applied to video games. **Game like board games and card games share the concepts. The medium in which they're expressed is different.** A video game is just a concept expressed through code.

Some decisions you may need to consider are, story decisions, rules, looks and feels, timing, pacing, risk-taking, rewards and punishments.

Again it is a ongoing process, ideas may not execute like how they were originally planed to. This way of thinking should be used throughout the game development.

**I'm realizing that I don't do any of this. I'll have a idea that I think is good, work for a year with my head down and then see if its fun after I'm done making it.**

## Waiting for Mendeleev

I apparently did not pass chemistry, Mandelevv discovered the periodic table. The idea is that there is no universal formula. Maybe there will be eventually, but we need to rely on assumptions and patterns that may be wrong and incomplete. 

**Good game design happens when you view the game from as many perspectives as possible.** Each perspective or lense is a tool to examine the game. They are questions you can ask and think about. Like all of the different reactions that those OChem ppl have to remember. Use as many imperfect lenses as you can to emulate a single lense of truth.

## Focus on Fundamentals
**The rules that govern games stay the same.** New 100 gb games by AAA companies still have the same basic principles. You don't need to chase them. *Study simple games first.* **Hopefully thats what I can accomplish with this gameboy project.** These old classic games are good to study because they withstood the test of time.

***"This book will not strive to cover ground, but to teach you to dig in the most fertile places."***

## Talk to Strangers

More so refers to the strangers of techniques, practices and principles. Don't just bury your head in work, engage with the outside world and integrate them into the games.

**No Cookie-cutter games**, playing it safe is boring. ***This is honestly my biggest fear when it comes to making games, I feel like after I master making fun games, there is nothing stopping me. I would have full confidence I could succeed.*** Draw design inspiration from everywhere.

## The map

**This book presents you with a bunch of nodes. But you have to make you're own web of connections through trial and error.** Books are linear, so you need to construct the network of relationships in your own brain.

**Practice, make games, thats the only way to learn. You can't learn how to ride a bike from reading a book.**

# In the Beginning, There is the Designer - 1

This chapter trying to bring out the motivation for doing this, where ppl are afraid to start making games. I, don't have this problem. But I will take away the fact that I should be more confident in my abilities.

The man in the arena

“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”

Theodore Roosevelt

Not a quote from the textbook, just a good one in general that aligns.

## The most import skill

Listening. 5 major catagories, Team, Audience, Game, Client and Self. (tf does self mean). You must be deeply listening, the comparison they use when a friend says "I'm fine" when their body language says they're not.

Accept the possibility that what you hear may upset you. But you have to be open minded, be like a child who knows nothing but does everything.

**Team** - everyone will have their strong suits, you need to listen to make sure everyone is being included.

**Audience** - thats where your money is, they they don't like it, then you fucking failed.

**Game** - Like a car mechanic who how a engine is broken just by hearing it run.

**Client** - The people funding you, give them what they want.

**Self** - ??? "the secret behind your tremendous creativity"

I feel like for my purposes, will focus on Audience, Game and Self. I'll deal with team when I get one/join one.

## The Secret of the gifted

Like fls said, people aren't born gifted, they worked their asses off to become gifted.

# The Designer Creates an *Experience* - 2

"What is the game designer's goal?", what is the magic that happens when the game is played? The experience. Each persons experience is unique. Aka, focus on each player's lasting impression on the game and how they interacted with it.

## The game is Not the Experience

The game enables the experience but it is not the experience. "If a tree falls in the forest, but no one is there to hear it, does it make a sounds?". Here, the sound is the experience, and the tree falling is the game. If no one hears it, then it doesn't fucking matter

The reason why people play games is for the experience that it provides. That is what makes a game a game. 

*We never see the truly see the output of our work, everyone has their own unique experience of the work. Something that is special to them and sharable* And we have to make a game that does this.

Fuck, this seems hard. How do you make something that does something so abstract.

**This connects to why deep listening is very important. I assume its bc you can understand what the people truly want? idk yet ig.**

## Is This Unique to Games?

No, everyone who works in entertainment has to consider, "How can you create something that will generate a certain experience when someone interacts with it".

With other mediums, its often a linear story/path. But in games, it is usually a diverging path where the player gets to control their own story. Sometimes theres even randomness tossed in to further influence the story.

This is the experience you are trying t chase.
- the feeling of choice
- the feeling of freedom
- the feeling of responsibility
- the feeling of accomplishment
- the feeling of friendship

Shit like this is stuff that you can only explore deeply through the interactivity of games.

## Three practical Approaches to Chasing Rainbows

How does one go about creating these experiences? How these experiences actually work under the hood. 

### Psychology

Scientific psychology works by thinking of the brain as a black box. Where as a scientist, you test things by giving stimuli and seeing what happens. But this does not tell us what actually goes on inside the box. As game designers, we won't need to follow the strict rules of reproducibility and absolute truth, instead we just need what is good enough to the truth. The study of psychology gives us a starting point to make inferences.

### Anthropology

The study of human beings and what they think and do. Studying the the similarities between people and why(culture, mental, physical). They often fully immerse themselves in the culture they want to study, allowing them to know what it truly "feels like". By being in their mind, you gain more insights then just observing from the outside.

### Design

Many designers focus thoroughly on a single sub category such as music or visual designers. It's hard to find a general rule of thumb or utilize these rules across boundaries. But still, anyone that that creates experiences can teach us something. We will try to build bridges between Psychology and Anthropology and Design. Use as many different ideas, use it like a **toolbox**.

## Introspection: Powers, Perils, and Practice

All of the three approaches all use introspection. *The act of examining your own thoughts and feelings*. Aka your experiences. This allows you to make **rapid and decisive judgments** about why the game isn't working and why.

*Peril - serious and immediate danger*

### Peril #1: Introspection Can Leave to False Conclusions About Reality

Our own experiences may not always be completely true. People often very large architectures of ideas which makes it seem true but it may be build of off questionable logic. We don't need the full truth tho, we just need to be good enough. When dealing with the human heart and mind, use introspection. Trust your feelings about the becomes a experience for someone else.

### Peril #2: What is True of My Experiences May Not be True for Others

Things are subjective, with the trap being "I like playing this game so it must be good." The two ways of getting around this is to only make games you like. Where it lets ensure the game is good. But this limits your audience heavily, especially if you have a niche taste. You can also only trust play-testers, which makes sure the game will be fun into production. But early on, there is no game to play-test, and they may not fully understand it if it's not a finished game (they may throw out a ugly duckling). By listening to your own experiences and others, you can see how their experiences differ. If you can put yourself in the mind of your audience, you can make predictions on their experience of the game.

## Dissect Your Feelings

Ok, side tangent, I don't think I'm in touch well enough with my emotions to see the value of this. Maybe I'm just better suited as a worker bee. I'll see tho.

It's not enough to know if you just like or don't like something. You need to be able to narrow it down to exactly what you like or don't like about it. Otherwise you don't know what to change in a bad game or what to take away from a good one. Seeing the differences in experiences, allows you to know the type of experience your game is supposed to create.

## Defeating Heisenberg

Intreating, like quantum mechanics or some shit. How do you observe a experience without effecting it since the act of observing is a experience. Oh shit, it is quantum, I didn't know the heisenberg principle was this. If you are enjoying yourself and try to observe yourself, you'll end up not having as much fun. 

### Analyze Memories

It's hard to observe while experiencing since then half the brain has to be allocated for that. But memories don't change that much, they may be imperfect but its good enough. Work with fresh memories too. 

Intreating, like when you're playing a game, don't play it and actively try to analyze it. But just know that you will right after you finish so you can strategically remember anchors instead.

### Two Passes

Do something twice. First time, just experience it have a clean mind. Second time, analyzing everything, take notes even.

### Sneak Glances

Its like seeing someone hot sitting across from you. If you stare, they'll notice. Instead just glance without drawing attention. Don't interrupt the train of thought. It's something like "Exciting enough? Yea, ok." instead of something deeper.

### Observe Silently

This seems hard, it's essentially saying to have the other part of your brain observe so silently that it doesn't bother the main. I guess just practice it. Like when you're watching a video, try to silently observe.
